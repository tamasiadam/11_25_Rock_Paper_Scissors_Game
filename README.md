# Task Description: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the player competes against the computer. The program should meet the following requirements:

# Task Requirements:
## 1. Introduction:

The program should greet the player when it starts, e.g., "Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!".


## 2. Player's Choice:

The player should input their choice (e.g., "rock", "paper", or "scissors") as a text string.

## 3. Computer's Choice:

The program should randomly select one of the three options: "rock", "paper", or "scissors".

## 4. Determine the Winner:
The program should decide if the player won, lost, or tied based on the rules of the game:
"Rock" beats scissors but loses to paper.
"Paper" beats rock but loses to scissors.
"Scissors" beat paper but lose to rock.

## 5.Track Results:
The program should keep a running tally of how many games the player has won, lost, or tied:
Increment the "wins" counter for a victory.
Increment the "losses" counter for a defeat.
Increment the "ties" counter for a draw.

## 6. Option to Play Again:
After each round, the program should ask the player if they want to play another game:
If the answer is "y", the game continues.
If the answer is "n", the program ends.

## 7. End of Game:
Before exiting, the program should display the total results (wins, losses, ties).

## Example Execution:
```python
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Choose your character: Rock, Paper, Scissors ->rock
Computer's choice: paper
You lost
Wins: 0, Losses: 1, Ties: 0
Do you want to play again? (y/n) y
```

## Bonus Ideas for Improvement:
- Make the input case-insensitive (e.g., "rock" and "ROCK" should both work).
- Add error handling to prompt the user for a valid input if they enter something incorrect.
- Display a farewell message with a summary, such as: "Thanks for playing! Final score: 3 wins, 2 losses, 1 tie."


Challenge: Modify the game to allow a "best of N" format, where the first to win a certain number of rounds (e.g., 5) becomes the overall winner!
